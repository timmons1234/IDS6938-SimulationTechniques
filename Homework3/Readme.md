# Homework 3 : Agent based Simulation Assignment 

## IDS6938-Simulation Techniques - [University of Central Florida](http://www.ist.ucf.edu/grad/)

This is the framework for homework #3. 

The assignment is due: **Tuesday, April  25 at 11:59PM (EST)**

# Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to enable the behavioral animation of vehicle-like walking agents. 

You will be expected to compose a *final report* which demonstrates your understanding on the material in each section of the assignment. Be visual! - Pictures say a thousand words so you do not have to. Show off your different configurations and really explore the assignment.


I'm using Google Docs to write the document. Here's a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vLcWumUYAgby2vSN-l5fRd6MZU2gC8tbJF54pigwBxg/edit?usp=sharing) to the report.
Files are uploaded to Github, and will be linked from within the report. 

This project is complete as of 4/25 unless I have some major epiphany and bang out some brilliant code. 

Besides, I have two finals to take and should really focus on those. 

Thanks!
