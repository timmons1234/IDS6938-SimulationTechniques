The assignment is due: **Tuesday, March 28 at 11:59PM (EST)**

# Part 1) Empirical Test of Randomness
- a) See "01.random number data.statistics 1.xlsx" each tab has a random number engine with associated chart showing the distribution for n=1000. Statistics are listed on the final tab. 
    - a) I generated average, median and stdev for each point. Statistics isn't something i do on a regular basis. In a team, I would look to others for additional statistics. 
    - b) I started researching how to generated the other suggested stats and realized i was out of depth and moved on to other parts. 
- b) I ran varied n sizes from my initial distribution. Statistics were generated and listed on the stats page. 
    - a) As N gets smaller, the STdev increases. Since I used smaller samples within the main set it changed the overall distribution of numbers within each set. 
- c) See "02.distribution data statistics.xlsx". Each tab is a distribution and numbers are represented by a side by side chart. statistics are listed on the stats tab. 
    - a) I reduced n to 1000 for this run. 
    - b) uniform and normal distribution made sense. I'm not sure what was entirely going on with the other distributions.
- d) See "03.random number unit square.xlsx" n=1000 for these. I generated 2 sets of data and used one for X and the other for y. I used uniform distribution and set bounds of -1 , 1
    - a) mr19937_64 has an n-10,000 
    - b) I think the first point to mention is n=1k isn't high enough. At the same time, 100,000 was too much. 50,000 also seemed to be too much. 
    - c) you need a meaningful sample size. As we were repeating a lot of tests here i settled on 1k for clarity with a second higher example. 
    - d) for the random numbers, they appear to be randomly distributed within the unit square
    - e) i didn't see any discernable patterns. It might be meaningful to repeat the test 5000 times and compare those results against each other.
    - f) as for part 4, i also generated the results on the unit square within this document. 
    - g) since this is generated in Excel, I did a conversion to make it appear no a scatter plot.
    - h) We ran into issues with some of them where they were coming up wrong. I ran an absolute value within the formula before the square root.
    - i) credit to stack overflow for the formula
    - j) this part was tedious af because you change the program, compile, run, output data, move to excel, insert charts. There's probably a better way, but it was outside the scope
- e) See "04.distribution unit.xlsx" n=1000
    - a) a lot of the same caveats as above
    - B) i ran a 10k run on normal as it came out looking good. 
    - c) my image isn't a true square so the circle looks skewed. 
    - d) I displayed results for the others as they came out. I trimmed them to show the results, but they're not bounded by -1,1
    - e) I probably did something wrong here, or it's my lack of understanding. 
    - f) circles are also displayed, but might not be actual circles
    - g) I like the (circle) plot for fischer. it reminds me of a particle emitter, like a damaged space engine from a game. 
- f) See D for random numbers and E for distribution

- g) Initially I didn't include Sobol. I added it as it's own file. See "05.sobol.xlsx".
    - a) I ran this at n-100,000 in the hopes it would look really pattern. 
    - b) We ran multiple tests against this to get it to look more like a pattern but however i changed the parameters it didn't look like the example. 
    - c) It does generate a pattern. But it doesn't look like the example. 
    - d) As of the study group monday, only sarah had a sobol which looked like a pattern.
    - e) her program looked like ours, we weren't sure why she had those results. 
    - f) the takeaway for sobol for me was you could use the seed to get repeatable random numbers

# Part 2) Snakes and Ladders
- a) null state
    - a) initially i generated this in perl as a csv
    - b) in the study group i junked it at the advice of others and we rewrote it as a loop
    - c) I generated the final lines by hand. 
    - d) since we have a matrix initially populated with 0s you only need to mark the areas where you have a result
    - e) the final cell is 1. if you "win" you transition to the same spot all the time.
    - f) the prior line is 1 as well if you're one spot out, all rolls win.
    - g) a good add here would be to terminate the loop when you succeed and mark the roll number
    - h) with the completed code, to run a null state game comment out the transition matrix modification class.
- b) null state analysis: unsure what to do here. 
    - a) Honestly, i'm excited i got the code into a working state where i could see the board. 
    - b) this is a giant leap forward compared to my experience with the jello cube. 
    - c) 
	
- c) Snakes and ladders transition
    - a) first item here, when you have a snake or a ladder you have a 0 at the transition point, and the probability is shifted to the destination
    - b) initially i wrote this identifying the column with a result and then subtracting it from the original location and adding it to the new location
    - c) this is important because we have a couple spots where we have overlap. overlap spots represent chance to land on the spot, or chance to be transferred to it
    - d) I ran sanity checking in my routine to sum all rows to verify we hit 1. Then look for stuff like empty variables or areas outside the row
    - e) When i rewrote to the loop i build these transition points by hand. 
    - f) serious take away here, the first row is 0. 
    - g) i had the program print the matrix and regexed it into excel. from there i was able to troubleshoot and clear up any issues
    - h) it takes significantly less rolls to complete when you add in this transition points.
    - i) It would be interesting to see the results of just snakes, or just ladders
- d) is this a game?
    - a) we've discussed this in class a couple times. 
    - b) Games are social constructs to promote social behaviours. 
    - c) I'd argue this is a game because it supports that. The focus is on shared activity around a common goal.
    - d) strategy wise this isn't a good example. results are purely on luck rather than choice. 
- e) see null state and transition state for matrixes

# Part 3)	Queue simulator
- a) I have an implemented and working simulation with files on github
- b) implemented
- c) implemented, formulas taken from webcourses. Ran into an issue here where i didn't () a variable and it broke things. Seemed common, I helped a couple of others who had the same issue.
- d) It generates statistics, but unsure how to analyze them
- e) Implemented in Anylogic. see Security_mm1.alp

# Part 4) Extra Features
- a) Additional Distribution
    - a) This isn't a tremendous deal. Before I realized we needed to use Sobol as part of the initial random number cases, I used default_random_engine for all tests. 
- b) Use case for Anylogic
    - a) Software Price compared to physical 
    - b) Free student/learning edition available
    - c) Speed to implement. 
    - d) Tools are prebuilt. 
    - e) Visual view of model promotes understanding
    - f) Modular components can be reused in other code
    - g) Provides a virtual environment to test changes
    - h) Modeling the process ahead of time promotes identification of potential issues and risk
    - i) GUI and pre built tools reduce required skillset and barrier to entry
    - j) Supports Agent based, discrete, system dynamics within one tool
    - k) Offers visualizations, broadening the audience and their understanding of the model

# Part 5) Report / Feedback



# Part 6) Extra Credit
- a) Anylogic snakes and ladders See SNL1.alp. 
    - a) I created a partial implementation of of the null state snakes and ladders using Anylogic. 
    - b) It shows a minimum of two rolls and a maximum of 7. 
    - c) Each space on the board is represented by a 0 second queue feeding into a choice object to simulate a roll. 
    - d) Our shortest path through the map is any combination of rolls totaling over 6 ex:1-6,3-4,6-6
    - e) Our longest path through the map would be a roll string of 1,1,1,1,1,1,1
    - f) There were two interesting problems to solve. 1) how to handle the roll within Anylogic and, 2) how to keep everything organized. 
    - g) Anylogic offers two choice trees: A single a/b option, and an a/b/c/d/e option. 
        - 1) Since our dice has 6 sides, we need to implement a workaround. 
        - 2) I fed from the queue into a choice tree with 2 50% option. Each option goes into another choice tree with 3 33% chances to proceed. 
        - 3) this way we have Ex from the starting point a)2,3,4 and b)5,6,7
    - h) Organization also became a key element. 
        - 1) Since each spot on the board creates 3 objects and 8 connection points, it quickly became a spaghetti nightmare. 
        - 2) There might be a more intuitive method within the program which controls where queues feed out to/in from. 
        - 3) In a full implementation, it would be optimal to add bends and connection points between objects, and lay them out cleanly. 
        - 4) Additionally, more space would help distinguish all the items. 
        - 5) With 101 queues, 300 choice objects and connectors between all items it might be difficult to keep track of where everything goes. 
        - 6) Unfortunately this creates a situation where you can't see it all in the same screen.
        - 7) Possibly implementing a 2/3d visualization would simplify keeping track of everything. 
    - i) While unimplemented, snakes and ladders could be implemented by connecting backwards or forwards to other tile objects. 


- b) 2d visualization of Part 3 See airport with 2d1.alp
